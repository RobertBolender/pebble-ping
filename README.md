Pebble Ping Pong
================

A very simple app for my [Pebble Classic](https://www.pebble.com/).

This app was born out of the need of developers seeking
wrist-based scorekeeping while playing Ping Pong.

The main entry point for the app is in [/src/js/app.js](https://github.com/awesomebob/pebble-ping/blob/master/src/js/app.js).

Built with [Pebble.JS](https://github.com/pebble/pebblejs).
